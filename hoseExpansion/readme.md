# Hose Expansion
## Purpose of code
I am working on a system to apply pressure to a number of radiator hoses. 
Looking at using a piston controlled by air or linear actuator.
This code calculates the force needed to raise the pressure in the hoses to 100 psi, the change in volume of the hoses, and the force needed to move the piston.
